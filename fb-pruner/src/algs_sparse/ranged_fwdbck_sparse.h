/* 
 *  FUNCTION: run_Bound_Forward_Sparse()
 *  SYNOPSIS: Perform Edge-Bounded Forward step of Cloud Search Algorithm.
 *            Runs traditional Forward-Backward Algorithm, but only performs
 *             computation on cells that fall within the bounds determined by
 *             the <edg> EDGEBOUNDS object, which stores a series of 
 *             (left-bound, right-bound) pairs sorted by row.  
 *            Normal state matrix is stored in linear space.
 *             <st_MX3> is size [3 * (Q + T + 1)]. Only requires size [2 * (T + 1)],
 *             but is reused from cloud_forward_().
 *            Final score produced by Forward is stored in <sc_final>.
 *
 *  RETURN:   Returns the final score of the Forward Algorithm.
