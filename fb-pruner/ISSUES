# KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS:

# TODO / FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

- Makefile: need to create a nested makefile to build fbpruner project after Easel tools are called.  Should all be called by a master makefile at top level (see HMMER codebase for example).

- Fix issues with reconstructing alignment in stdout. Bug should be in "sequence.c" or "report.c".

- Fix issues with generating

- Fix commandline parsing. Should use a hash table (UMAP) to store args until parsing is finished.
